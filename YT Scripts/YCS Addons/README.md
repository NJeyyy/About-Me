`Note: The dev literally suck tho.. This is rlly easy to achive but y'knowww.... ðŸ¤“`  
`So I add some function THAT I WANT:DD with this userscript!!`  
<br>
Here some functionality that I added to i just to make me feel more comfortable on using it.

Optional Function that it added:
- Focus on YCS Search Field[^1]
- When blurred with shortcut, will go to top of page[^2]
- Edit the "type" attribute to add clear field button
- Add physical function (just adding more button)
  * Button for: Go to Top of page
  * Button for: Toggle select text on focus.[^3]

[^1]: This thing created shortcut. That focus on search field everytime I press the hotkey ("Alt"+"S" by default)  
And also select All text (if available), when the field is on-focus. You could disable some function.. to do that; add "//" at the first collumn <s>(or before the command)</s> on the line of command <s>(/function)</s> you wanted to disable.  
[^2]: Can be disabled
[^3]: Could be customized on how it's started (i.e Turned ON/OFF)
