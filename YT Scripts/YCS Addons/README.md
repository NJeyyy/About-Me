The dev literally suck tho.. This is rlly easy to achive but y'knowww.... ðŸ¤“<br>
I add some function <s>(although it's only have 2 rn, STFU)</s>, but it's a start okayyy. So **APPRECIATE IT!** <s>or you're mom will dissapointed of grew you up</s> <br>

This have 2 function rn:
- Focus on YCS Search Field[^1]
- When blurred with shortcut, will go to top of page[^2]
- Edit the "type" attribute to add clear field input
<br>
<br>

[^1]: This thing created shortcut. That focus on search field everytime I press the hotkey ("Alt"+"S" for now)  
And also select All text (if available), when the field is on-focus. You could disable some function.. to do that; add "//" at the first collumn <s>(or before the command)</s> on the line of command <s>(/function)</s> you wanted to disable.  
[^2]: Can be disabled
