`Note: The dev literally suck tho.. This is rlly easy to achive but y'knowww.... 🤓`  
`So I add some features THAT I WANT:DD with this userscript!!`

Here some features that I created to just make me feel more comfortable and convenient while using it.!

Features added with this userscript:
- Focus on YCS Search Field with shortcut[^1]<br>
  `*When blurred with shortcut, will go to top of page`<br>
- If the search input blank and the user press `enter` It's gonna clear the comment result and unfocus the search field immediately
- Edit the "type" attribute to add clear field button
- Add physical function (just adding more button)[^4]
  * Toggle search input filter: timestamp matching[^2]<br>
   > Find comment with the timestamp in the search input (if specified), then highlight the comment and bring it to the top<br>

   `ATTENTION!! It still in BETA since I need to face the problem first and its still kind of problematic lmao`<br>
  * Button: Go to Top of page<br>
   > Left-click go to top in search result, Right-click in the page

  * Toggle button: select all-text in search field when focused.[^3]
  * Toggle button: Pause video when search input focused
  * Toggle button: Unfocus text automatically in specified time after user enter it
  * Button: Switch YCS-Box mode
- Add YCS element box various theme to make it much more convenient
  * Overlay
  * Simple Overlay
  * Default
- Show what text being search (specified by the text or the button filter)

<strong>So much change after 2 month🤧🙃😆</strong><br>

<br>
<br>

[^1]: Hotkey is "Alt"+"S" by default  
And also select All text (if enabled), when the field is on-focus. Its also toggleable by the button<br>
[^2]: Still in BETA version, so it's a bit unstable and problematic. I'll try to improve it tho!
[^3]: Could be customized on how it's started (i.e Turned ON/OFF)
[^4]: All of the below could be disabled or enabled
