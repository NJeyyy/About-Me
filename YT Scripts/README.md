 ## This is YT Scripts Section
 
 Here is a list of what script already created on this section:
 - \[YCS Addons\]
    * Focus on YCS search field[^1]
    * Option physical function (just adding more button)
      + Go to Top of page
      + Toggle select text on focus.[^6]
 - YT Optional features[^2]  
   `Fun fact: There's a loading overlay to wait the script runs`  
   `Since it takes a while for the script to running..`
    * Add shortcut to Skip Ads  
      `So you can skip ads whenever you want without wait for the button`
    * Change the Theme based on time[^4]  
      `The theme of the site gonna change based on time the setted.`  
      `You could edit it on your own(just figure that on yourself)`  
    * Toggle theme by button.[^5]
    * Stop Autoplay on load **~~(not on URL changes)~~*  
    * WIP Script[^3]
<br>

There's the thing that in my opinion is cool enough to store here!


[^1]: Add custom shortcut for it + Add some function when it focused/blurred.
[^2]: Adding more features to YT site!
[^3]: Subtitle Settings restored. Didn't know it works or not. Not already being tested. (yeah.. that's the only WIP Script :D)
[^4]: Still on-work, so it might buggy and a bit unstable)
[^5]: So you did not must to go to the profile section AND WAIT IT TO LOAD.. or edit the file to your desire **EVERY. SINGLE. TIME**
[^6]: Could be customized on how it's started (i.e Turned ON/OFF)
