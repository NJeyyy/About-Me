> I just created the minified version of this userscript! Please use that instead of the original one,<br>

 Here is a list of what script already created on this section:
 - \[YCS Addons\]
    * Focus on YCS search field with shortcut/hotkey
    * Optional physical function (just adding more button)
    * Add `Mode` to the YCS Box (Element Top-Container)
    * Show what text being searched below the search field
    * And more! [`Check it out here`](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/tree/Userscripts/YT%20Scripts/YCS%20Addons)
 - YT Optional features  
   `Fun fact: There's a loading overlay to wait the script runs`  
   `Since it takes a while for the script to running..`
    * Add shortcut to Skip Ads  
      > So you can skip ads whenever you want without wait for the button  
    * Change the Theme based on time  
      > The theme of the site gonna change based on time the setted<br>
      > <em>*You could edit it on your own(just figure that on yourself)</em><br>
    * Toggle theme by button.<br>
      > So you did not must to go to the profile section AND WAIT IT TO LOAD.. or edit the file to your desire **EVERY. SINGLE. TIME**
    * Stop Autoplay on load (and on URL changes) `Video will keep played if there's an ads`  
    * WIP Script[^1]
<br>

There's the thing that in my opinion is cool enough to store here!
