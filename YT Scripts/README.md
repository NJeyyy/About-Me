 ## This is YT Scripts Section
 
 Here is a list of what script already created on this section:
 - \[YCS Addons\] Focus on YCS search field[^1]
 - YT Optional features[^2]
    * Add shortcut to Skip Ads  
      `So you can skip ads whenever you want without wait for the button`
    * Change the Theme based on time[^4]  
      `The theme of the site gonna change based on time the setted.`  
      `You could edit it on your own(just figure that on yourself)`
<br>
Yep..[^3]<br>
There's the thing that in my opinion is cool enough to store here!


[^1]: Add custom shortcut for it + Add some function when it focused/blurred.
[^2]: Adding more features to YT site!
[^3]: no seriously I have a lot, I just not store it here.. to lazy!
[^4]: Still on-work, so it might buggy and a bit unstable)
