This is the first Userscript I made..  
Named...⬇⬇⬇  
## Focus on YCS search field
This Userscript is to make shortcut. That focus on search field everytime I press the hotkey ("Alt"+"S" for now)  
And also select All text (if available), when the field is on-focus.[^1]  
You could disable some function.. to do that; add "//" at the first collumn ~~(or before the command)~~ on the line of command~~(/function)~~ you wanted to disable.
