HI!<br>

### Welcome to "Userscripts" part!!  

Here's a quick list:<br>
- Logs File  
  *It's only presented to 2 script[^EE] bcs I'm to lazy to do it anymore*
- UserScripts Page  
   `There are 3 Category`  
  * Global Tool Script  
  * Other individual side-website  
  * YT Scripts  
- ~~(WIP)*~~[^*]


So.. <br>
THIS IS ME NOW.[^1] I am **NOW** using "Userscript"!<br>
..Although ..y'know.. doesn't use ppl userscript..<br>
Just make my own now😎 (Well.. sometimes use ppl, but not frequently.<br>
I use [Tempermonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd) at first.. but now.. [**ViolentMonkey**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao)!!<br>
TBH [ViolentMonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao) sucks, and [Tempermonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd) better :)<br>
But I still use VM[^2] now because.. uhh.. I am to lazy to switch..😞🙄<br>
THE UI IS DOPE!! OKAY!!!.. and also at first TM[^3] it's kinda broken bro--although the problem is me-not the extension L😔🙏<br>
TM[^3] is better functionality and more advanced, and VM[^2] is better UI and easier to use-<br>
I mean.. I also to lazy to switchy swatcha back.. Already have my shoes wet here. And it feels like home rn.. So...<br>
<br>
Oh yea.. also I am using *UserScript* now because it seems that I really need the function to use my extension or other thing that cannot be applied by other ppl work. I cannot make my "Extension" rn so.. yeah.. USERSCRIPT FOR NOW U <strike>BITCH</strike><br>
<hr>
Btw.. It's still a small project. But.. Oh my, can't wait for it to develop to be "things" that <strike>maybe</strike> will change my life😆😀🧐<br>
<br><br>
<strong>Okay that's it for this 'README.md'. Cya when it's develop to be better (again)😄</strong>
<br><br>


[^1]: FYI I actually hate any "Userscript Manager"😂  
It is because I hate Userscript––It's just to complicated.. and never work for me- <strike>(before)</strike>
