HI!<br>
### Welcome to "Userscripts" part!!<br>
Here a quick list😄:<br>
- Logs
- UserScripts Page
- (WIP)*<br>
**Work in progress*

There only one Userscript called "Focus on YCS search field" though..<br>
<del>BUT SOON THERE WILL BE MORE!! I am new at this okay--</del><br>
But either way..[^1] I am **NOW** using "Userscript" although.. y'know.. doesn't use ppl userscript..<br>
Just make my own now😎<br>
I use [Tempermonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd) at first.. but now.. [**ViolentMonkey**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao)!!<br>
TBH [ViolentMonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao) sucks, and [Tempermonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd) better :)<br>
But I still use VM[^2] now because.. uhh.. I am to lazy to switch..😞🙄<br>
THE UI IS DOPE!! OKAY!!!.. and also at first TM[^3] it's kinda broken bro--although the problem is me-not the extension L😔🙏<br>
TM[^3] is better functionality and more advanced, and VM[^2] is better UI and easier to use-<br>
I am using *UserScript* now because it seems that I really need the function to use my extension or other thing that cannot be applied by other ppl work. I cannot make my "Extension" rn so.. yeah.. USERSCRIPT FOR NOW U ~~BITCH~~<br>
Okay that's the Intro..<br>

**BYE!!**


[^1]: Btw FYI I literally hate any "Userscript Manager"😂 It's just to complicated.. and never work for me-- (before)
