## GlobalFunction - Global Tool Script
Userscript(/JS) that be used globally across internet. It runs on any webpage and runs along with another userscript.  
That userscript	cannot be run without some of these this script, or they will turned out to work abnormally and seems a bit broken.[^1]  
<br>

#### And since then, here's the list of the userscript available here.
- [**FontIcon Script**  ](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/blob/Userscripts/Global%20Tool%20Script/FontIcon%20Script.js)  
	> Add FontIcon(<link>/<script>) to the page so it can be used on other userscript<br>
	> When they making an element or other stuff that use this.
- [**Optional EventListener**  ](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/blob/Userscripts/Global%20Tool%20Script/Optional%20EventListener.js)  
	> Add custom EventListener that not available on some website. But really needed<br>
	> on some userscript. To do/runs some event that related.
- [**Disable User Selection on document**  ](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/blob/Userscripts/Global%20Tool%20Script/Disable%20User%20Selection%20on%20document.js)  
	> `Note: This is individual userscript.`  
	> Disabling user selection on page.(with button) It's disabled by default[^2]  
	> And could be turned on by editing the script. Or by clicking the button on the right-bottom.
- [**Custom Addition ToolScript**  ](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/blob/Userscripts/Global%20Tool%20Script/Custom%20Addition%20ToolScript.js)[^5]  
	> Some script that mostly be used. So I combine them here.  
	> I also make it to implement it to <head> So it can be used GLOBALLY[^3]  
	> `NOTE!` Sadly the you cant use it in the userscript except you use @require and use the link [*here*](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/blob/Userscripts/Global%20Tool%20Script/Custom%20Addition%20ToolScript%5BOnly%20the%20script%20list%5D.js)<br>
	> and there is also another one you could use for your userscript [*here*](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/blob/1b4a61868e711e461848561e24f6ebf3b76c7304/ToolScript_Global.js)! *Just a recommendation lol*
	> **Just FYI, There is the minified version please use that instead if you're just planning to use it.‚óï‚à™‚óï**
	
	---
For userscript Requirements: They can be found on top/bottom of script:D *(Except if they're is the minified version)*  
btw if it's doesn't exist, it's **not** gonna warn you.. So just make sure you already install them.[^4][^6]  
<br>
~ Enjoy :D
	
[^1]: Note: btw, it doesn't mean it **must** to always turned on. Just check on the userscript you use on this repositories  
and see their requirements. Because actually some of these are individual script, and turns out to need other script  
to accompany it.
[^2]: Meaning you still be able to selecting things on the start of script.
[^3]: Smart right? I knowüòéüòè
[^4]: Except for "Custom Addition ToolScript". It's already use '@require' thingy..[^6]
[^5]: For embed version is [this one](https://github.com/NJeyyy/About-Me/blob/6c0b5f907013e79133ae8eef7a8bf8fd7f38d43a/Global%20Tool%20Script/Custom%20Addition%20ToolScript%5BOnly%20the%20script%20list%5D.js)  
[^6]: Okayy.. I cannot add the warning lol srry
