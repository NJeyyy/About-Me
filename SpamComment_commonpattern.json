		"John 3:16\n[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\nLuke 13:3\n[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\n\nJohn 14:6\n[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\n\nMatthew 18:11 \nFor the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.\n\nJohn 8:12\n[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. \n\nMatthew 4:17\n From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\n\nRomans 10:9 \nThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\n\nRomans 10:13\nFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. \n\nLuke 6:27-38\nBut I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, \n6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. \n6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. \n6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. \n6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. \n6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. \n6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. \n6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. \n6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. \n6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. \n6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: \n6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.\n\n\nEphesians 2:8-9\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\nNot of works, lest any man should boast.\n\n2 Chronicles 7:14\nIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\n\nMatthew 5:2-12\nKing James Version\n2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,\n3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\n8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\n9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\n10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\n12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\n\nMatthew 24:4-14 \nAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.\n24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\n24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.\n24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\n24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.\n24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.\n24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.\n24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\n24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\n24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\n\n\n..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..\n\n..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..\n\n..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..\n\n..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..,,..\n\n....,,....,,....,,....,,....,,....\n\n\n\n\n\n......./,,,,_"
